# Covid_Status

I've done a project before to display covid status around the globe. But the statistics wasn't accurate since the API used was returning incorrect or old data.
Due to the lack of API's which give correct data, I've written a program in JavaScript which parses updated results from the table provided by World Hearth Organization in their official website, www.https://covid19.who.int/table .

So now it's giving a bit more accurate results eventhough it's not 100% correct. Most probably the table which i've parsed may not be up-to-date.
For the front end part, Materialize CSS is used. For parsing csv file to json, PapaParse is used.
